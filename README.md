# Responsive Design and Media Queries Example

This project was created with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## About

This is a lighthearted webpage that uses media queries and responsive design principles to properly display an ecommerce page with the moon for sale on various device sizes. This webpage serves as an example of applied CSS concepts. If I learn new concepts in the future that would improve the design, I may make changes. I have commented notes throughout the code as a guide for myself and others.

## CSS

- **Flexbox**

- **Linear-gradient**

  The **background** color transitions according to the function.
  I also used the **to right** property with linear-gradient on the button element.

- **Transition**

  The width of the _buy_ button changes on hover over a specified time.

- **Transform**

  **translateX** is used to adjust the position of the color block.

- **Pseudo-element**

  **::after** is used to display a color bar.
  The pseudo-element contains a linear-gradient example as well.

## JavaScript

This code allows a mobile user to toggle the navigation menu at the top of the page open/close. This only happens when the viewport width is less than 700px. Above 700px, the menu icon is hidden with CSS and the menu options display inline at the top of the navigation bar.
